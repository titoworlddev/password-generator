# Vue Password Generator

This is a practice project with Vue.JS, it is a password generator that, in addition to generating them, allows you to copy them to the clipboard. </br>It also allows you to choose the length of the password, if you want it to have numbers, uppercase, lowercase and/or symbols. </br>It even has a section to be able to generate a secure password, from a phrase that you choose, mixing the characters in the phrase. In this way, you will have a personalized password, but it is safe because it is not your literal phrase. </br>It is a very simple application but it can be very useful.
